- Circular dependency detection and prevention
- Service registration and resolution methods
- Memory usage tracking and optimization
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Debug capabilities for development

**Key Methods:**
- `register($name, $factory, $dependencies)` - Register services with dependencies
- `get($name)` - Resolve services with lazy loading
- `has($name)` - Check service availability
- `clearCache()` - Clear service cache for testing
- `getMemoryStats()` - Get memory usage statistics

### 1.2 SecurityManager Service ✅
**File:** `includes/SecurityManager.php`
**Test File:** `tests/php/TestSecurityManager.php`

- Capability-based access control
- File path validation (directory traversal prevention)
- Rate limiting functionality
- Security event logging
- Output escaping for different contexts

**Supported Data Types:**
- Text, email, URL, color, CSS, HTML, numbers, booleans
- Array sanitization (recursive)
- File upload validation
- Custom validation rules with options

### 1.3 CacheManager Service ✅
**File:** `includes/CacheManager.php`
**Test File:** `tests/php/TestCacheManager.php`

**Features Implemented:**
- Multi-level caching (memory, WordPress transients, object cache)
- Performance metrics collection and monitoring
- Cache invalidation strategies
- Memory usage optimization with LRU cleanup
- Cache warming functionality
- Hit rate calculation and efficiency tracking
- Automatic cleanup and memory management

## Additional Components

### Service Bootstrap System
**File:** `includes/ServiceBootstrap.php`

**Features:**
- Centralized service registration
- WordPress integration hooks
- System status monitoring

- Service dependency management example

### Integration Testing
**File:** `tests/php/TestCoreIntegration.php`

**Features:**
- Cross-service integration testing
- Performance validation
- Memory usage testing
- Error handling verification

## Architecture Benefits

### 1. Dependency Injection
- **Loose Coupling:** Services are not directly dependent on concrete implementations
- **Testability:** Easy to mock dependencies for unit testing
- **Flexibility:** Services can be swapped or extended without changing dependent code
- **Lazy Loading:** Services are only instantiated when needed

### 2. Security-First Design
- **Input Validation:** All user input is validated and sanitized
- **CSRF Protection:** WordPress nonces protect all operations
- **Access Control:** Capability checks ensure proper permissions
- **Attack Prevention:** XSS, SQL injection, and directory traversal protection

### 3. Performance Optimization
- **Multi-Level Caching:** Memory, object cache, and transients for optimal performance
- **Metrics Collection:** Detailed performance monitoring and optimization
- **Memory Management:** Automatic cleanup and memory limit enforcement
- **Efficient Operations:** Debounced operations and batch processing support
