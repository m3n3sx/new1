# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical repair of the Live Admin Styler WordPress plugin's completely broken user interface functionality. The plugin currently has non-functional tabs, broken sidebar menu interactions, missing submenu functionality, and no working options. This urgent repair will restore core UI functionality to make the plugin usable while maintaining compatibility with the existing codebase structure.

6. WHEN I use keyboard navigation THEN tabs SHALL be accessible via Tab and Enter keys
7. WHEN tabs are displayed THEN they SHALL have proper ARIA attributes for accessibility

### Requirement 2: Sidebar Menu and Submenu Functionality

2. WHEN I adjust sliders THEN they SHALL move smoothly and display current values
3. WHEN I modify text inputs THEN they SHALL accept input and show validation feedback
4. WHEN I toggle switches/checkboxes THEN they SHALL change state with proper visual feedback
5. WHEN I select dropdown options THEN they SHALL update and show selected values
6. WHEN form controls are used THEN they SHALL trigger appropriate change events
7. WHEN validation occurs THEN error messages SHALL be displayed clearly and helpfully

### Requirement 4: JavaScript Initialization and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want the plugin's JavaScript to load and initialize properly so that all interactive features work without console errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the admin page loads THEN there SHALL be zero JavaScript errors in the browser console
2. WHEN JavaScript initializes THEN all required dependencies SHALL be loaded in correct order
3. WHEN initialization fails THEN there SHALL be graceful fallback behavior

6. WHEN dependencies are missing THEN the system SHALL provide informative error messages
7. WHEN JavaScript is disabled THEN basic functionality SHALL still be accessible

### Requirement 5: Asset Loading and Dependency Management

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want all plugin assets (CSS, JavaScript) to load properly so that the interface appears and functions correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the admin page loads THEN all required CSS files SHALL be loaded and applied
2. WHEN JavaScript files are loaded THEN they SHALL be in proper dependency order
3. WHEN assets fail to load THEN there SHALL be fallback mechanisms
4. WHEN the page renders THEN styling SHALL be consistent and complete
5. WHEN assets are cached THEN cache busting SHALL work properly for updates
6. WHEN multiple admin tabs are open THEN assets SHALL not conflict between tabs
7. WHEN WordPress updates occur THEN asset loading SHALL remain functional

### Requirement 6: Event Binding and User Interactions

7. WHEN touch devices are used THEN touch interactions SHALL work properly

### Requirement 7: State Management and Persistence

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want my UI state (active tab, form values, etc.) to be preserved and synchronized so that my workflow is not interrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I switch tabs THEN the current tab state SHALL be saved automatically
2. WHEN I reload the page THEN my previous UI state SHALL be restored

7. WHEN state data becomes corrupted THEN it SHALL be reset to safe defaults

### Requirement 8: WordPress Integration and Compatibility
