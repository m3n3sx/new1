# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical repair of the Live Admin Styler WordPress plugin's completely broken live preview system. The plugin currently has no working live preview functionality, JavaScript errors, failing AJAX requests, and no settings persistence. This urgent repair will restore core functionality to make the plugin usable while maintaining compatibility with the existing codebase structure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Live Preview System Restoration

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want the live preview system to work immediately when I change settings so that I can see my customizations in real-time without any errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I change any form element (color picker, text input, slider, toggle) THEN the live preview SHALL update within 300ms with debounced handling
2. WHEN the admin page loads THEN there SHALL be zero JavaScript errors in the browser console
3. WHEN I modify any plugin setting THEN the preview SHALL update instantly without page refresh
4. WHEN the live preview updates THEN it SHALL apply changes using CSS injection without affecting other admin functionality
5. WHEN multiple rapid changes occur THEN the system SHALL debounce updates to prevent excessive processing
6. WHEN the preview system initializes THEN it SHALL load in under 1 second on WordPress 6.0+
7. WHEN I test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge THEN the live preview SHALL work consistently across all browsers

### Requirement 2: AJAX Communication System Repair

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want reliable communication between the frontend and backend so that my settings are saved properly and I receive appropriate feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I save settings THEN AJAX requests SHALL complete successfully with proper WordPress nonce validation
2. WHEN AJAX requests fail THEN the system SHALL retry automatically up to 3 times with exponential backoff
3. WHEN network issues occur THEN requests SHALL timeout appropriately (10 seconds) and show user-friendly error messages
4. WHEN AJAX operations execute THEN they SHALL use proper WordPress wp_localize_script for configuration
5. WHEN server errors occur THEN the system SHALL log errors and display graceful user notifications
6. WHEN multiple AJAX requests are made THEN they SHALL be queued properly to prevent conflicts
7. WHEN CSRF protection is needed THEN WordPress nonces SHALL be validated on every request

### Requirement 3: Settings Persistence and Storage

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want my settings to be saved reliably to the database and restored when I return so that my customizations are not lost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I change settings THEN they SHALL be saved to the WordPress database with proper sanitization
2. WHEN I reload the admin page THEN all my previous settings SHALL be restored accurately
3. WHEN settings fail to save THEN the system SHALL use localStorage as a backup mechanism
4. WHEN I have multiple admin tabs open THEN changes SHALL be synchronized across tabs
5. WHEN settings are saved THEN they SHALL be validated and sanitized for security
6. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options
7. WHEN I export/import settings THEN the data SHALL maintain integrity and compatibility

### Requirement 4: Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want clear feedback when operations succeed or fail so that I understand what's happening and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN operations succeed THEN I SHALL receive positive visual feedback (success notifications, green indicators)
2. WHEN errors occur THEN I SHALL see user-friendly error messages with actionable guidance
3. WHEN AJAX requests are processing THEN I SHALL see loading indicators to understand system status
4. WHEN JavaScript errors occur THEN they SHALL be caught gracefully without breaking the interface
5. WHEN network connectivity issues arise THEN I SHALL receive appropriate offline/connectivity messages
6. WHEN validation fails THEN I SHALL see specific field-level error messages
7. WHEN the system recovers from errors THEN I SHALL be notified that normal operation has resumed

### Requirement 5: Form Element Integration

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want all form elements to trigger live preview updates so that I can see the effect of every setting change immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use color pickers THEN they SHALL trigger live preview updates on every color change
2. WHEN I modify text inputs THEN they SHALL trigger debounced preview updates after 300ms of inactivity
3. WHEN I adjust sliders or range inputs THEN they SHALL trigger immediate preview updates
4. WHEN I toggle switches or checkboxes THEN they SHALL trigger instant preview updates
5. WHEN I select dropdown options THEN they SHALL trigger immediate preview updates
6. WHEN I use custom form controls THEN they SHALL integrate with the live preview system
7. WHEN form validation fails THEN the preview SHALL not update until valid input is provided

### Requirement 6: Performance and Memory Management

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want the live preview system to be fast and efficient so that it doesn't slow down my admin workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the live preview system runs THEN memory usage SHALL not exceed 25MB peak
2. WHEN preview updates occur THEN they SHALL complete within 100ms for optimal responsiveness
3. WHEN multiple rapid changes happen THEN debouncing SHALL prevent excessive DOM manipulation
4. WHEN the system has been running for extended periods THEN there SHALL be no memory leaks
5. WHEN CSS is injected THEN it SHALL be optimized and minified for performance
6. WHEN the admin page loads THEN the live preview system SHALL initialize without blocking the UI
7. WHEN cleanup is needed THEN the system SHALL properly dispose of event listeners and DOM elements

### Requirement 7: WordPress Integration and Compatibility

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want the live preview system to work seamlessly with WordPress core and other plugins so that it doesn't cause conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN WordPress 6.0+ is used THEN the live preview SHALL maintain full compatibility
2. WHEN other admin plugins are active THEN the live preview SHALL not conflict with their functionality
3. WHEN WordPress admin themes are used THEN the live preview SHALL adapt appropriately
4. WHEN WordPress hooks and filters are used THEN they SHALL follow WordPress best practices
5. WHEN the plugin is activated/deactivated THEN it SHALL not leave orphaned data or scripts
6. WHEN multisite is used THEN the live preview SHALL work correctly in network admin contexts
7. WHEN WordPress updates occur THEN the live preview system SHALL continue functioning without modification
