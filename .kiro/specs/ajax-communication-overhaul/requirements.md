# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Live Admin Styler plugin currently suffers from a broken AJAX system that causes settings save failures, poor user experience, and unreliable communication between the frontend and backend. This feature will implement a bulletproof, enterprise-grade AJAX communication system with comprehensive error handling, retry logic, and queue management to ensure reliable data transmission and excellent user experience even under adverse conditions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator using Live Admin Styler, I want my settings to save reliably every time, so that I don't lose my customization work due to AJAX failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user saves settings THEN the system SHALL attempt to save with automatic retry logic (maximum 3 attempts)
2. WHEN a save operation fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message explaining what went wrong
3. WHEN network conditions are poor THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff between retry attempts
4. WHEN a save operation succeeds THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual confirmation to the user
5. IF a save operation fails after all retries THEN the system SHALL preserve the user's input and offer manual retry options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want the plugin interface to remain responsive during AJAX operations, so that I can continue working without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple AJAX requests are triggered THEN the system SHALL queue them to prevent race conditions
2. WHEN a long-running operation is in progress THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator
3. WHEN requests are queued THEN the system SHALL process them in the correct order
4. WHEN the user triggers rapid successive actions THEN the system SHALL deduplicate identical requests
5. IF a request takes longer than 30 seconds THEN the system SHALL timeout and provide appropriate feedback

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want to receive clear feedback about any AJAX errors, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to resolve it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a network timeout occurs THEN the system SHALL display "Connection timeout - please check your internet connection"
2. WHEN a server error (500, 502, 503) occurs THEN the system SHALL display "Server error - please try again in a moment"
3. WHEN a permission error occurs THEN the system SHALL display "Permission denied - please refresh the page and try again"
4. WHEN a nonce validation fails THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh the nonce and retry the request
5. WHEN rate limiting is encountered THEN the system SHALL display "Too many requests - please wait a moment before trying again"

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a WordPress site owner, I want the AJAX system to be secure and follow WordPress best practices, so that my site remains protected from security vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any AJAX request is made THEN the system SHALL validate the WordPress nonce
2. WHEN processing AJAX requests THEN the system SHALL check user capabilities for the required permissions
3. WHEN receiving user input THEN the system SHALL sanitize and validate all data before processing
4. WHEN sending responses THEN the system SHALL use proper JSON formatting with appropriate HTTP status codes
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them securely for debugging without exposing sensitive information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the Live Admin Styler plugin, I want comprehensive logging and debugging tools, so that I can quickly identify and resolve AJAX-related issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AJAX requests are processed THEN the system SHALL log request details for debugging purposes
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log the error with context information (user ID, timestamp, request details)
3. WHEN retry attempts are made THEN the system SHALL log each attempt with the reason for failure
4. WHEN debugging mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide detailed console output for developers
5. IF performance issues are detected THEN the system SHALL log timing information for optimization analysis

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator using Live Admin Styler on various devices and browsers, I want the AJAX system to work consistently across all platforms, so that I have a reliable experience regardless of my setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using modern browsers THEN the system SHALL use the fetch() API for optimal performance
2. WHEN using older browsers THEN the system SHALL fallback to XMLHttpRequest for compatibility
3. WHEN network conditions vary THEN the system SHALL adapt timeout values based on connection quality
4. WHEN using mobile devices THEN the system SHALL optimize request payloads for slower connections
5. WHEN JavaScript is temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide graceful degradation options

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator working with large styling configurations, I want the AJAX system to handle bulk operations efficiently, so that I can manage complex setups without performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large data sets THEN the system SHALL chunk requests to prevent server timeouts
2. WHEN multiple settings are changed simultaneously THEN the system SHALL batch them into efficient requests
3. WHEN bulk operations are in progress THEN the system SHALL show detailed progress information
4. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL implement cleanup procedures to prevent browser crashes
5. IF bulk operations fail partially THEN the system SHALL report which items succeeded and which failed
